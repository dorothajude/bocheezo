I think we can all agree Brawl Stars is a great mobile game, but the only thing I feel is missing is the lore (even though they had minuscule description for each character which were removed). That being said, I have decided to take what has been given by the game: the characters and their personalities (maybe their skins) to create a story and background for all the characters.

I'm on my senior year of high school and finding jobs that actually have decent pay is impossible. I went from retail to fast food to helping in my uncle's small pet shop. But nothing
