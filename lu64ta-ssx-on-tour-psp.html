                            <p> my big collection of crap is here!

On Tour for the PSP was based very closely to SSX 3 more so than it was to the console version of On Tour. Within the game itself, all its tracks are based off of SSX 3 tracks with names changed up. The file structure is also closely the same, with the PSP version of on tour still containing a config folder exactly the same as PS2 SSX 3. One of these config files contains data detailing the soundtrack, which is the SSX 3 soundtrack. This folder likely has no purpose in the PSP version. # Have: #Xbox One All CiB unless noted Rise of the Tomb Raider Lego Marvel Avengers Fallout 4 Battlefield 1 Sunset Overdrive Dark Souls III Dishonored 2 Dead Rising 4 Grand Theft Auto V Final Fantasy XV #Playstation 4 ALL CiB unless noted Horizon: Zero Dawn Complete Edition Ratchet and Clank God Of War (Hard Trade) #Xbox 360 All CiB unless noted Call of Duty: Black Ops Left 4 Dead 2 Portal 2 Mortal Kombat Battlefield Bad Company Hey everyone.
