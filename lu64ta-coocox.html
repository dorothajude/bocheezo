After I got some great suggestion (https://www.reddit.com/r/microcontrollers/comments/4kh22h/how_to_get_started_with_arm/) I just found an ARM board name Nutiny SDK Mini 51 from Nuvoton ( in my electronics box that I bought a year ago(2014) and didn't try it yet but While I waiting for Nucleo Board (http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-e.

CooCox does not seem to support this particular discovery board, so I was thinking of using System Workbench. I am pretty new to all this, and my knowledge of programming is limited to C, with close to zero embedded programming or microcontroller experience. So I was wondering how you create applications for your boards. edit: the site for System Workbench is openstm32.org ( Please. Продолжаем тему таймеров в stm32.

Hi, Im doing a project using a STM32L151 and the recommended environment is coocox ide from coocox.org, page apparently doesn't exist any more Someone has a recommendation for other IDE? or should I search for an old version. Hi all! Ive got some experience with programming AVRs in C as a hobbyist. I recently saw patrick hood daniel's series of videos about programmimg STM32s with C in CMSIS using the CooCox IDE. Im not such a big fan of HAL and the Cube shenanigans. Is there anyone out there kind enough to suggest a good book to learn CMSIS programming :)? Ive seen the STM32 technical manuals but i really think they are too difficult Hi, THIS (https://world.taobao.com/item/524482277610.htm?fromSite=main&spm=a230r.1.14.46.ebb2eb2dRHGPR&ns=1&abbucket=7#detail) is the link to the board that he got me. Looking around for tutorials I managed to setup the CooCox IDE and the GNU toolchain. After making a simple LED blink program I realized I had no idea about how to upload it to the board. I see that the board comes with a CH340 usb to serial chip, can I use the usb ports on the board to flash the memory? Hey everyone, Does anyone have any good beginners guides to the STM32f4 libraries. Been struggling to find any manual that describes the functions and how to go about using them. I'm using CooCox but also have ARMKeil. The manuals I have found are out of date. Thanks in advance 
Hi all! I still have some ways to go before I max out the usage of my Atmega chips. But i would just like to know whats in the horizon as I hear that ARM Cortex-M chips are the future of micro controllers in high end projects! Ive done some research but could anyone help me out with some questions?:) Especialky qn 3! ( just to clarify, i am only interested in the ARM cortex M chips that are designed for microcontrollers! ) 1. Just for some clarification, the AVR is a chip architecture designed. Hey everyone, I recently picked up a Nucleo board and I'm struggling to find any solid documentation on the libraries or how to implement them. Been struggling to get the SPI going. A lot of online sources for instance give this as a line of code for selecting the SPI line: SPI_Cmd(SPI1, ENABLE); although Coocox doesn't recognize this as a command nor can I find it in any library. Is there any up to date tutorials or resources for this library? Can't seem to find anything in depth Thanks. Hi. I am working on a project where I need to generate a customized firmware for an IoT device. The firmware has to be generated from the server by invoking the tool with certain configurable parameters like username, password and other parameters from the customer end. I am planning to use an ARM based Microcontroller (STM32) with open source tools like CooCox CoIDE. I will host a webpage on the server through which the customer can enter the configurable parameters. with that information. 
I've seen a lot of ARM being used in Kickstarter project but it don't know where to get start. I google it but seems like there are many choice. I want some detail and easy guide line to how to get start with it. Such as suggestion board, IDE, resource, community Edit1 :I forgot to give the details. Thank you pseydtonne 1. I want to start develop STM32F4 with freee IDE. I've seen many people in my university use crack version of IAR and Keil uVision but the price is super high. 2. I didn't.

Hey everyone, At my work we're currently working on an open hardware / software project. We were previously using Yagarto but it is time to move on as it is getting forgotten. Therefore we're looking for an IDE we could use on Linux and windows. Coocox & emide's long term plans include Linux support but something tells me it will be in the very long term. Would anyone know such kind of IDE? Thanks. Clicking on the link given below takes me to buykeyonline.com on chromium, whereas it works properly on Firefox. Has my system been compromised?

Hello fellow tinkerers, I have a problem: I used the Memory Map to allocate: First Block: Start 0x2000000 Lenght 0x0002FFFF Second Block: Start 0x1000000 Lenght 0x0000FFFF on a Discovery Board STM32F429 (the one with the Touchscreen) in the CooCox memory configuration of my project. In theory this should give me the ability to write at least 90000 u_int16 values into an array. As soon as I write more that 3000 values the discovery board crashes right after flashing the new software. Just wondering if anyone has set up Vim for compiling C for the STM32F4 Discovery board. I would love to start tackling some projects, but I can't stand CooCox and the like. Does anyone have any tips as to how to set up Vim for easily pointing to libraries, organizing header and source files I can't figure out why my code doesn't work! I've worked with TIM1 and everything works fine but when I change to TIM8, PC6 and PC7 are always on and the complementaries always off. Here is the code (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4pu-9T2Fws1WGEzMVgxX3RyX0E&authuser=0) I use on CooCox CoIDE. Any somewhat current resources for setting up the environment with Sublime? Best I've seen is NakLojik's incomplete guide ( (I know you read this sub.), which only deals with the windows side of the Sublime integration. There is another one in russian which I've been able to follow most of the way through, but still not working.

Most of the structure fields should be fairly self-explanatory: we’re specifying the audio frequency, whether or not we’re sending the master clock signal But why just imagine when it already can be so?
